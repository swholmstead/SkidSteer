<h2>Assembly Instructions</h2>

<h3>Mast</h3>

Attach pulleys to mast sections with M2.6 x 6mm screws.  Ensure that pulleys swivel easily.  You may have to drill out outer holes to ensure that screws roll easily.

<h2>Rear Cover</h2>

Attach seat to seat support and rear hatch with M2.6 x 6mm screws.  I like to add some adhesive tire weight to the rear cover to provide
conterbalance when Skidsteer is lifting heavy objects.  Attach propane tank holder with TPU trap to outside of rear cover. Attach propane tank.
