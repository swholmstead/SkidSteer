<h2>Assembly Instructions</h2>

<h3>Wheels</h3>

Solder 100mm of wire with JST-XH connector to N20 12V motors.  Push on 2 drive shafts and 1 pinion gear onto motors.

Insert blank drive shafts and motors with drive shafts through bearings and secure motor with motor lock and M2.6 x 6mm screws.
The right motor is in the front and the left motor is in the rear.

Attach a wheel spacer (optional) and a wheel hub to each drive shaft and secure with M2.6 x 8mm screws.
You may need to drill out the single layer of support material in each wheen hub.

<h3>Arm Gears</h3>

Attach the intermediate arm gear to the arm motor lock with an M2.6 x 6mm screw.

Attach track tensioners to each side of cab with 2 M2.6 x 6mm screws.  There are multiple holes to adjust tension on tracks.
I like to use the second hole from the top.

<h3>Bucket and Claw</h3>

Attach the 9g servos to the bucket and claw with claw bracket.  Allow a little slack in the servo wires to allow
for full movement.  Route wires along right arm.

When attaching the servos, you need to align them so that the starting position has the bucket sitting level with the ground.
The starting position for the claw is all the way open.  You may need to return later and adjust servo starting positions
after the electonics are complete and installed to ensure that claw opens/closes all the way and the bucket doesn't
bind up when fully up.
